<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS START -->
Always open `@/.specify/memory/constitution.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/.specify/memory/constitution.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines
